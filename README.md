--- Password Manager â€“ Secure Desktop Application ---
A secure desktop application for storing and managing passwords. I built this project to sharpen my skills with Python and practice using encrypting, hashing and authentication in an application.

Features:
    User signup and login with hashed passwords
    Store, encrypt, and decrypt password entries securely
    Dashboard to view masked passwords
    Add, reveal, and delete password entries
    SQLite database backend for local storage
    Implemented using Python and PySide6 for GUI

Usage:
    Sign up with your email and a master password
    Log in using your credentials
    Add passwords for different services in the dashboard
    Reveal passwords when needed
    Delete users or logout safely

Technology/Dependencies:
    Python 3.10+
    PySide6 (GUI framework)
    SQLite (local database)
    cryptography (Fernet encryption)
    argon2-cffi (password hashing)
